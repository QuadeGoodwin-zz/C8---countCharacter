Write a function called "countCharacter".

Given a string input and a character, "countCharacter" returns the number of occurences of a given character in the given string.


Copy and paste this outside the function to test it.

var output = countCharacter('I am a hacker', 'a');
console.log(output); // --> 3


Use a for loop to scan through the string and compare the characters.
